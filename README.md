## Introduction

Below are some SQL query projects I developed, broadly grouped by theme or scope in given areas of applications.  
None of it were used in code as part of applications, but rather externally as means for inquiry, conference, homologation and overall assist for the team's understanding of SQL's specificities, complex functions, requirements, etc. It may not make much sense as standing alone query without data, but the sintax and methods are accurate.

* Gamificacao-Full Extrato Pontuacao  
A custom report of a gamification module, detailing both points acquired by the user and points spent by any means.

* PA-Config  
Extracting the configurations of one instanced object at a time in a target audience module, with some recursive mechanics, data transformation and lots of case/unions.

* Rel-Avaliacoes  
About assessments in general of users in a learning module, both a detailed report of grades and answers of all types of assesments, and individually extraction of registered assesments' configurations and correct answers by each type. Lots of data transformation and big union blocks.

* Rel-Biblioteca  
Quick report of items published in a library module, with a few specifities.

* Rel-Repositorio  
Broad report of all objects registered or published in a largely used repository module, with details of currently stored objects, being used or no. Also a few data transformation on each object category to be considered.

* Rel-Trilha  
Quick reports of registered tracks and its configurations in a learning track module, and a quick script of error validation in a numeric field by math sequencing.
